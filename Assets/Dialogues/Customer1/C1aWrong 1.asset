  - 'Customer: You fumble with the key, hands slow to obey you. You slam your foot
    onto the accelerator and speed away from the smoke.'
  - 'Customer: Your gaze flickers over to the picture of you and your girlfriend
    on the passenger seat. You hope that, like always, she was faster, smarter than
    you.'
  - 'Customer: Your sweaty fingers slip from the wheel, the engine whining as you
    careen off the road.'
  - 'Customer: You think only of the wide smile you took from her before your skull
    shatters like the glass of the car windows.'
