  - 'Customer: You scramble up the loft ladder while holding the towel to your face
    - you crack open the window and squint against the wave of heat that rises from
    the fire below.'
  - 'Customer: Once you''re up on the roof you hear a chuffing sound in the distance.
    Above the falling trees and scattering wildlife, a helicopter moves towards you.'
  - 'Customer: Your mobile phone pings, signal finally returning. Her goodbye sits
    in your inbox. A simple ''I love you'' before the fire swallowed her up.'
  - 'Customer: You''re weary of all her words, her soft strange ways. But you''ll
    never grow tired of hearing that.'
  - 'Doctor: There you are, back in the present.'
  - 'Doctor: Thanks for coming in, I hope this gives you some closure. '
