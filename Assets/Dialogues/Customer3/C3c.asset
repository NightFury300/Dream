  heading: The Dungeon
  sentences:
  - 'Customer: This one has strange engravings on it that run from the centre to
    the bottom. It''s heavy, only budging when Alf lends a hand.'
  - 'Customer: Alf''s torch quickly uncovers why the door was so heavy. A creature
    hangs before you with the limbs of a man and the head of a goat.'
  - 'Customer: Four heavy chains hold its arms and legs up. Stretched out like a
    leather hide. Blood pools under it.'
  - 'Customer: "What is that monstrosity?" Alf shrinks back, shaking his head. "We
    must leave this vile place, right this instant."'
  - 'Customer: He pulls at the door but it stays put, even when he pulls with both
    hands. "Help me with this door, dammit!" '
  - 'Customer: You move to help him, but something strikes the back of your head
    and you crumple to the floor.'
  - 'Customer: When you come around this time, you aren''t greeted by Alf softly
    snoring to your left. A sharp pain shoots up your back.'
  - 'Customer: There''s a trail of dried blood leading you out into another tunnel
    through an open door.'
  - 'Customer: It''s less cramped and a stream runs down the middle of it. You push
    through double doors into a large chamber.'
  - 'Customer: A boney arm swings out in front of you aiming straight for your throat. '
  options:
  - 'Pull out your sword '
  - 'Duck! '
