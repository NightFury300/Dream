  sentences:
  - 'Customer: I wish to forget, this memory is beginning to affect my work.'
  - 'Doctor: Of course, make yourself comfortable.'
  - 'Customer: The birds'' early morning song wakes you up. The rising sun flickers
    in your eyes and you sit up on the bench, lighting your pipe. You take a long
    draw and glance to your left.'
  - 'Customer: Relief settles in your sore muscles to find Alf still snoring beside
    you. You break the peace by kicking him awake, eager to start the long walk ahead
    of you.'
  - 'Customer: You sought the same things so many fellow travellers - merchants,
    thugs, self-proclaimed heroes - sought every year: coin and adventure.'
  - 'Customer: It''s around midday when you find the ruins, clearly untouched by
    those who came before you. Mother nature had started to reclaim the precarious
    structure.'
  - 'Customer: Vines and moss hid an old set of stairs, leading down to a gloomy-looking
    tunnel.'
  - 'Customer: Alf lights a torch, giving you just enough light to see the roots
    peeking out of the damp cobbled walls. Something drips, like clockwork every
    second.'
  - '"This place doesn''t sit right with me, Alf..."'
  - 'Customer: You press on until the torch reveals a door, and open it with a loud
    creak. The stench of death invades your nostrils and you gag. Alf holds the light
    forward.'
  - 'Customer: You see bits of bone sticking out of the floor. A rat darts from one
    blood-smeared wall to the other."I did say."'
  - 'Customer: You lift your leg to step forward but it won''t budge. Alf brings
    the light down to your ankle, and you see it sinking into the ground. '
  - 'Customer: You try to pull free with your other leg, but only succeed in getting
    that stuck too. The thick mud wraps around it, moving as if alive.'
  - 'Customer: Alf gulps and draws back. "What should I do?"'
