  sentences:
  - Customer:You hear footsteps behind you and whip around,clutching your mace.A
    hooded figure holds up it's hands. "The sacrifice has been made,you will be spared."
  - Customer:You don't remember much after you stumble into daylight.You wake with
    the sun again, the birds rising on cue.
  - Customer:The medallion is a heavy weight on your chest and you daren't look to
    your left.There is a long road ahead.
